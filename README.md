# GeometryDashSaver
A geometry dash local (and OneDrive) save manager.
# This needs OneDrive to work.
This uses OneDrive to save the files across multiple computers.

I originally made this for myself because I had issues with getting an account, and I needed a way to transfer Geometry Dash data across all of my computers.
